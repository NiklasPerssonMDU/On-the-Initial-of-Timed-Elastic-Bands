# Bicycle multibody simulation in simscape

## Authours
Niklas Persson

## Setup 

The code is written in MATLAB 2022b and the simulation is created in Simulink 2022b

### Required toolboxes

- [Simscape Multibody](https://se.mathworks.com/products/simscape-multibody.html)
- [Simscape](https://se.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html)

## Usage
- Run `simBicycle.m` to run the simulation with the default parameters. In the script you can parameters such as sample time, noise parameters for the lean angle measurements and the steering velocity.
- The simulink file `BicycleModel.slx` includes the simulink model and the simscape model of the instrumented bicycle.
